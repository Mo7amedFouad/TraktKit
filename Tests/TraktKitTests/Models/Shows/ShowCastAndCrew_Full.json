His work in theatre, including an award-winning performance in the title role of the Royal Court Theatre's \"Hamlet\", led to several supporting roles in film and television. He made his breakthrough screen performance in Terry Gilliam's 1985 cult film \"Brazil\". Critically lauded for his versatility, Pryce has participated in big-budget films such as \"Evita\", \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"The New World\", as well as independent projects such as \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" and \"Carrington\". His career in theatre has also been prolific, and he has won two Tony Awards—the first in 1977 for his Broadway debut in \"Comedians\", the second for his 1991 role as \"The Engineer\" in the musical \"Miss Saigon\".",
